# MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

## Week1-Lecture 1

* Knowledge:
	+ Declarative knowledge: statement of a fact
	+ Imperative knowledge: how-to knowledge/recipe to find sth
* Algorithms:
	+ recipes, sequence of mechanical steps for doing sth
* Mechanically
	+ Fixed Program Computers
		- Computers which only do one thing that they are designed to do
	+ Stored Program Computers
		- a machine that stores and manipulates instructions
			* sequence of instructions (programs) stored inside computer
			* special program (interpreter) executes each instruction in order
		- 6 primitives sufficient to compute anything - **Turing complete**
			* ways to abstract methods to create new `primitives`

* Aspects of languages
	+ Primitive constructs
		- numbers/strings/operators -> words in English
	+ Syntax - well-formed
	+ Semantics - meaning
		- static semantics: which syntactically valid strings have a meaning 
		- Semantics (语义): no statics semantics, the meaning intended to do

> Computational mode of thinking: taking a problem description and breaking it down into a recipe, a sequence of how-to steps
